# Heads up!

I appreciate any bug report or other contributions, but please remember that **this issue tracker is only for the client library**.

_I do not maintain the API_ that this library talks to, nor am I affiliated with Todoist at all. ðŸ˜ž If you have any issues or questions about the API itself, please have a look at [the official documentation](https://developer.todoist.com/rest/v8/).

Thanks! ðŸ™Œ
